title: Setup
---

Part 1 of this course requires access to some kind of Python environment, which
may be any of:

- A plain Python interpreter
- An IDE, e.g. PyCharm, Visual Studio Code
- A JupyterHub instance at your organisation
  - For courses taught at the University of Edinburgh, staff and students have access
    to Noteable at https://noteable.edina.ac.uk/login. If you wish to use this, log
    in here and proceed to GUI setup or command line setup below.
- A JupyterLab instance on your local machine

For part 2 on Napari, you'll need access to a machine with Napari installed.
Installation of Napari is covered below.

## Python Setup

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: discussion

### Details

We recommend Jupyter as a powerful way of saving your progress and displaying your
work in Python. All setup done here is based on either [Conda](https://docs.conda.io)
or [pip](https://pip.pypa.io) with Python
[virtual environments](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html).

### JupyterHub - GUI setup

Once logged in, select 'New -> Folder' in the top right menu. This will create a new
folder called 'Untitled'. To rename it, check the box next to it, select 'Rename' in
the top left and enter a suitable name for this course. Navigate into the folder by
selecting its name in the navigator.

Now do the same steps again to create a folder called 'test_data' and navigate into
it.

Now that you're in a sensible location, you can upload select the 'Upload' button in
the top right and select the files to upload.

In the folder you've created, select 'New' -> 'Python 3 (ipykernel)'. This will open a
Jupyter notebook in a new browser tab.

### JupyterHub - command line setup

Once logged in, select 'New -> Terminal' in the top right. This will open a command line
shell in a new tab. Once here:

- Use `mkdir` to create a folder for this course and `cd` into it
- Inside here, use `mkdir` to create a 'test_data' folder and `cd` into it
- Use `wget` to download the test data

Now that the folders and test data are set up, navigate to your new course folder in the
GUI and select 'New -> 'Python 3 (ipykernel)'. This will open a Jupyter notebook in a new
browser tab.

### Jupyter installation

If you don't have access to a JupyterHub instance but will want to use Jupyter, you can
install it locally:

       $ conda install -c conda-forge jupyterlab  #Â with Conda
       $ pip install jupyterlab                   # with Pip

Once installed, start Jupyter with:

       $ jupyter-lab

This will start the server process and open JupyterLab in a new browser window.

:::::::::::::::: solution
### Local setup

If you wish to use Python on its own, then that is also possible.
You will also need skimage, imageio, numpy and matplotlib.

When working with a local Python instance, it's almost always a good idea to install
packages into a **virtual environment** such as those created by Conda or Python's
`venv` module.

       $ python -m venv ./python_environment
       $ source ./python_environment/bin/activate
       $ pip install skimage imageio numpy matplotlib

## Napari setup

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: discussion

### Details

While Napari has developed enormously in recent years, installing it still requires
the use of Pip and/or Conda.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

:::::::::::::::: solution
### Installation with Pip

Pip is Python's package manager. To install Napari into a Python virtual environment:

```
$ python -m venv path/to/new/virtualenv
$ source path/to/new/virtualenv/bin/activate
$ pip install 'napari[all]'
```
:::::::::::::::::::::::::

:::::::::::::::: solution
### Installation with Mamba

Mamba is an alternate, faster environment solver for Conda. You can try
installing with Conda, but you may find it extremely slow.

```
$ mamba create -p path/to/new/env -c conda-forge napari pyqt
```
